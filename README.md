# TOF Sensor Data Collection

## Project Overview

### Context

In Singapore, in the face of bicycle related traffic accidents, traffic rules require cars to overtake bicycles at a minimum distance of 1.5m.

### Objective

The goal of this project is to collect data on the passing distance of cars to bicycles, as reliable data on this subject of study does not exist. I use a Time of Flight (TOF) to collect the data, which uses infrared technology to measure distance accurately. The sensor is mounted a bike which is used to ride around Singapore roads, collecting data which can be further analyzed.
